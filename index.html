            <h3>Why I like Watching YouTube Videos</h3>
            <p>I like watching YouTube videos because it keeps me entertained. There is a wealth of content on YouTube that is free to consume. Music is also found on YouTube, which is convienient because listening to music is one of my other hobbies.</p>

            <h3>How to Watch YouTube Videos</h3>
            <p>Watching YouTube videos can most easily be done by navigating to <a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube.com</a> or opening the YouTube app on your phone. Once you reach the website or app you can search for video topics or creators you want to watch using the search bar, or you can click a video on the home page. YouTube will eventually pick up on the types of videos you watch and recommend more to you on your homepage, which is quite convienient. However, If you want to discover new content, you can navigate to the "New to you" section (image shown bellow), which shows videos that you haven't watched but might be interested in.</p>

            <h3>How I prefer to Watch YouTube Videos</h3>
            <p>You can use the YouTube app and/or the YouTube website to watch YouTube videos, but they come with ads and in video sponsorships. I have crafted my YouTube watching experience to minimize ads and sponsorships. On a computer, I use <a href="https://brave.com/" title="Link to brave website" target="_blank">brave</a> as my browser, which has a built in adblocker. I also have an extension called <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone" title="Link to sponsorblock extension" target="_blank">sponsorblock</a>, which skips YouTube sponsor ads. On my phone, I have an app called <a href="https://newpipe.net/" title="Link to newpipe website" target="_blank">newpipe</a>, which is just like YouTube (and can access YouTube videos) but does not show ads. Every now and again newpipe breaks because of some YouTube update, however a newpipe update to fix the issue is usually released within a few days. Newpipe is open source, so there are other versions of it (though I haven't tried them). As you can probably tell, I really don't like ads and sponsorships, I see them as a waste of my time. Since I consume (and have consumed) a lot of YouTube videos, the total amount of ad time I have saved is probably in the weeks.</p>

Besides the entertainment factor, informative and educational content can also be found on YouTube. If you have time to waste and feel bored, it is a great place to go to be entertained and/or learn something.</p>
